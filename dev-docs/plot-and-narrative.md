# Plot and Narrative Design
## Emily and the Ghost of Elizabeth Ann Seton

## Historical Background

### Elizabeth Ann Seton (1774-1821)
Elizabeth Ann Bayley was born into a wealthy Episcopalian family in New York City on August 28, 1774. She married William Magee Seton at age 19 and had five children. After her husband's death, she converted to Catholicism in 1805, facing significant social ostracism. In 1809, she founded the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph's, the first religious community for women in the United States. In 1810, she established the first free Catholic school for girls in America, becoming the founder of the Catholic parochial school system. She died on January 4, 1821, in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Her miracles included the healing of Anne Theresa O'Neill from acute leukemia in 1952. She was canonized on September 14, 1975, becoming the first American-born saint.

### Seton Hall University
Founded on September 1, 1856, by Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley (first cousin of James Roosevelt I, father of President Franklin Roosevelt), Seton Hall is the oldest diocesan university in the United States. Bishop Bayley named the institution after his aunt, Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton, 35 years after her death. The university is located on a 58-acre campus in South Orange, New Jersey, 14 miles from Manhattan. Key landmarks include Walsh Library (opened 1994) with its iconic domed Rotunda, the Immaculate Conception Chapel, Boland Hall, and the Green.

### The National Shrine Grotto
The National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in Emmitsburg, Maryland, is the oldest US replica of the Lourdes shrine in France, built just 17 years after the 1858 apparition. Mother Seton and her sisters lived near the Grotto in a log cabin for six weeks and attended Sunday Mass at the chapel on the mountain. The site is a mountainside shrine featuring a cave-like grotto that has been considered a holy place since the 1850s.

## Overall Plot Summary

Emily, the gallery director at Seton Hall University's Walsh Gallery, encounters the ghost of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton who is deeply troubled by the corruption and spiritual decay that has infected the university grounds. The saint is particularly incensed by the proliferation of poorly-executed portraits of priests throughout campus—artworks so terrible they insult both artistic standards and religious dignity. She tasks Emily with a sacred quest: collect holy relics (her hair and finger bone), defeat the corrupt forces (predatory priests, lazy students, and incompetent administrators), and ultimately confront Satan himself, who has taken over her beloved Grotto in Emmitsburg, Maryland.


Emily must journey through four locations on the Seton Hall campus—starting from the Parking Lot, moving through the Walsh Gallery and Library, and finally confronting a boss in the Administration Building. After proving herself worthy, Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton reveals the true threat: Satan has desecrated her sacred Grotto in Emmitsburg. Emily must travel to Maryland for a final confrontation in the cave-like shrine, battling through hordes of demons to reclaim the holy site. Victory brings divine intervention as the Archangel Michael appears to celebrate the triumph of good over evil.

## Narrative Themes

1. **Corruption vs. Purity**: The contrast between Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton's pure mission of education and charity versus the modern corruption of predatory priests and bureaucratic incompetence
2. **Art as Spiritual Expression**: Bad art as a symptom of spiritual decay; the quest to collect good art while fighting with bad art as weapons
3. **Historical Legacy**: The weight of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton's legacy and the responsibility to honor it
4. **Sacred vs. Profane**: The desecration of holy spaces (the Grotto) and the mission to restore sanctity
5. **Humor in Horror**: Satirical treatment of institutional problems while maintaining respect for the saint's genuine holiness

### Cutscene 1: The Ghostly Summons (Opening)
**Location**: Parking Lot (Emily arriving for work)  
**Background**: Parking lot with campus buildings visible in background  
**Characters**: Emily, Ghost of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton

**Sprite Configuration**:
- Emily: `emily-right.png` (standing sprite)
- Emily dialogue portrait: `emily-headshot-for-cutscenes+dialog.png` (displays when Emily speaks)
- Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton: `round-ghost-sprite_0-left.png` (ghostly form)

**Dialogue**:

**EMILY**: *walking toward campus, coffee in hand* Just another day at the gallery. Maybe I'll finally get those new acquisitions catalogued...

**GHOST**: *appearing suddenly in front of Emily* Emily, I need your help. The university grounds are in peril.

**EMILY**: *startled, dropping her coffee* A ghost? This is... unexpected. Who are you?

**GHOST**: I am Elizabeth Ann Seton, the woman for whom this university was named. I died in 1821, but my spirit remains bound to the institutions I helped create.


**EMILY**: Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton? The first American-born saint? I... this is incredible!

**GHOST**: Yes, yes, canonized September 14, 1975. But we don't have time for pleasantries. Have you SEEN the state of this campus?

**EMILY**: What do you mean?

**GHOST**: *gesturing dramatically* These halls are filled with corruption! Predatory priests lurking in shadows, students too lazy to pursue knowledge, administrators who care more about paperwork than people! And don't even get me STARTED on these portraits!

**EMILY**: The... portraits?

**GHOST**: *pointing at a painting on the wall* Look at this! LOOK AT IT! This is supposed to be a portrait of a priest, but the proportions are all wrong, the brushwork is amateurish, and the expression makes him look like he's plotting something nefarious—which, granted, he probably is, but that's beside the point! The artistic quality is ABYSMAL!

**EMILY**: *suppressing a smile* You're... complaining about the art quality?

**GHOST**: I founded the Catholic school system in America! I dedicated my life to education, to excellence, to lifting people up through knowledge and beauty! And THIS is what they've done with my legacy? Terrible art everywhere, corruption in the halls, and my sacred Grotto... *trails off, looking troubled*

**EMILY**: What about the Grotto?

**GHOST**: We'll get to that. First, you must prove yourself worthy. I need you to collect my sacred relics—strands of my hair and a bone from my finger. They hold holy power that will aid you in battle.

**EMILY**: Battle? I'm a gallery director, not a warrior!

**GHOST**: You'll fight with what you know best—art! Throw these terrible portraits at the enemies. At least they'll be good for something. The relics will grant you powers: my hair will make you invulnerable for a time, and my finger bone will unleash a holy spell to smite multiple foes at once.


**EMILY**: This is insane. But... if you're really Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, and you need my help... I'll do it.

**GHOST**: Good! Start in the parking lot. Yes, even there the corruption has spread. Lazy students and confused administrators wander about. Clear them out, collect what relics you find, and work your way through the campus. I'll guide you along the way.

**EMILY**: And then?

**GHOST**: Then we deal with the Administration Building. And after that... *her expression darkens* ...we travel to Emmitsburg, to my Grotto. Something terrible has happened there. But first, prove yourself here.

**Historical Note**: Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton (1774-1821) was born into an Episcopalian family in New York City. After her husband's death, she converted to Catholicism in 1805. She founded the Sisters of Charity in 1809 and established the first free Catholic school for girls in America in 1810, becoming the founder of the Catholic parochial school system.

**Dialogue**:

**GHOST**: *appearing beside Emily* Well done in the parking lot! You're getting the hang of this.

**EMILY**: I just threw bad art at people until they went away. I'm not sure this is what I signed up for when I became a gallery director.

**GHOST**: *laughing* Oh, Emily, you have no idea how many problems can be solved by throwing bad art at them! Now, let's head to the Walsh Gallery. That's your domain, isn't it?

**EMILY**: Yes, it's where I work. The gallery is on the first floor of Walsh Library, which opened in 1994. It's supposed to enhance the intellectual life of the university through dynamic exhibitions.


**GHOST**: *sighs* "Supposed to" being the operative words. I've been watching, Emily. I've seen what goes on in those halls. Corrupt priests using their positions of trust to prey on the vulnerable. It makes me sick.

**EMILY**: *quietly* I've heard the rumors too. It's... it's hard to know what to do.

**GHOST**: That's why I'm here. That's why YOU'RE here. We're going to clean house, starting with the gallery. There's a particularly nasty one lurking in there right now, and more of those AWFUL portraits on the walls. Seriously, who approved these? The composition is terrible, the color palette is muddy, and don't even get me started on the anatomy!

**EMILY**: *smiling despite herself* You really are passionate about art quality.

**GHOST**: I'm passionate about EXCELLENCE, Emily! When I founded my schools, I didn't settle for mediocrity. I taught my students to strive for greatness in all things. These portraits are an insult to that legacy!

**EMILY**: I'll do my best to... deal with them.

**GHOST**: Good. And keep an eye out for more relics. My finger bone should be in the gallery somewhere. You'll need its power for what's coming.

**Historical Note**: Walsh Library opened in 1994 as a 155,000-square-foot facility featuring an iconic domed Rotunda. The Walsh Gallery on the first floor hosts exhibitions to enhance the university's intellectual life.

- Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton: `round-ghost-sprite_0-left.png` (ghostly form)

**Dialogue**:

**GHOST**: *appearing with a satisfied expression* Excellent work in the gallery! Did you see the look on that corrupt priest's face when you hit him with that terrible portrait of Bishop Whoever-That-Was?

**EMILY**: I'm still processing the fact that I'm fighting people with bad art. This is the weirdest day of my life.


**GHOST**: *chuckling* Oh, Emily, if you think THIS is weird, wait until we get to the Grotto. But first, we need to clear out the rest of Walsh Library. The Rotunda, the stacks, all of it.

**EMILY**: The library is supposed to be a place of learning and quiet study. What's happened to it?

**GHOST**: The same thing that's happened to everything else—corruption, laziness, bureaucratic nonsense. Students who won't read, administrators who won't help, and more of those DREADFUL portraits. I swear, if I see one more painting with incorrect perspective, I'm going to... well, I'm already dead, so I suppose I can't do much. But YOU can!

**EMILY**: *looking at the relics she's collected* These powers you've given me... the invulnerability from your hair, the holy spell from your finger bone... they're incredible. How is this possible?

**GHOST**: I performed miracles in life, Emily. In 1952, my intercession cured Anne Theresa O'Neill of acute leukemia. The doctors called it impossible, but faith made it real. These relics carry a fraction of that divine power. Use them wisely.

**EMILY**: I will. But... you keep mentioning the Grotto. What's really going on there?

**GHOST**: *her expression becomes grave* After you clear the library, we face the Administration Building. There's a boss there—a manifestation of all the bureaucratic evil that's infected this place. Defeat it, and I'll tell you everything about the Grotto. But I warn you, Emily... what waits there is far worse than anything you've faced so far.

**EMILY**: *steeling herself* I've come this far. I won't back down now.

**GHOST**: That's the spirit! Now go—the library awaits. And Emily? Thank you. For caring. For fighting. For honoring what this university was meant to be.

**Historical Note**: Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton performed miracles, including the healing of Anne Theresa O'Neill from acute leukemia in 1952, which was recognized by the Catholic Church during her canonization process.

- Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton: `angel-flipped.gif` (animated, more powerful angelic form)

**Dialogue**:

**GHOST**: *appearing with an unusually serious expression* Emily, you've done remarkably well. The parking lot is clear, the gallery is cleansed, and the library is safe again. But now comes the real test.

**EMILY**: The Administration Building?

**GHOST**: Yes. The heart of bureaucratic corruption. Forms in triplicate, policies that help no one, administrators who've forgotten that they serve students, not the other way around. And at the center of it all... a boss. A powerful manifestation of everything that's gone wrong.

**EMILY**: I've fought corrupt priests and lazy students. I can handle some paperwork-obsessed administrator.

**GHOST**: *shaking her head* This is different, Emily. This isn't just one person—it's a system. A system that protects predators, that enables laziness, that values procedure over people. It's taken physical form, and it's strong.

**EMILY**: Then I'll use everything you've taught me. The relics, the art, all of it.

**GHOST**: *placing a ghostly hand on Emily's shoulder* You have the strength. I see it in you. You remind me of myself, in a way—someone who cares deeply about education, about beauty, about doing what's right even when it's hard.

**EMILY**: *touched* Thank you. That means a lot, coming from you.

**GHOST**: *stepping back* But Emily, there's something I need to tell you. Something I've been holding back.

**EMILY**: The Grotto?

**GHOST**: *nodding gravely* Yes. The National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, in Emmitsburg, Maryland. It's where I lived, where I taught, where I attended Mass every Sunday with my sisters. It's a holy place, built just 17 years after the apparition at Lourdes in France. A mountainside shrine with a cave-like grotto, dedicated to the Blessed Mother.


**EMILY**: It sounds beautiful.

**GHOST**: *her voice breaking slightly* It WAS beautiful. But something has happened. Something terrible. The corruption here at Seton Hall—it's not isolated. It's part of something larger, something darker. And that darkness has reached my Grotto.

**EMILY**: What do you mean?

**GHOST**: *looking directly at Emily* Satan himself has taken over the Grotto. He's filled it with demons, desecrated the holy cave, mocked everything that place represents. He's trying to destroy my legacy, to corrupt the very ground where I walked with God.

**EMILY**: *shocked* Satan? As in... THE Satan?

**GHOST**: The adversary. The deceiver. The enemy of all that is good. He's always been there, Emily, working through corrupt priests, through institutional evil, through the small compromises that lead to great sins. But now he's made himself known, and he must be confronted.

**EMILY**: *overwhelmed* I'm just a gallery director! How can I possibly fight Satan?

**GHOST**: You won't be alone. You'll have my relics, my guidance, and most importantly, you'll have righteousness on your side. But first, you must prove yourself one final time here on campus. Defeat the boss in the Administration Building, and then... then we travel to Emmitsburg together.

**EMILY**: *taking a deep breath* Okay. Okay. I can do this. I WILL do this.

**GHOST**: That's my girl. Now go—show that bureaucratic nightmare what happens when someone actually cares about doing the right thing!

**Historical Note**: The National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in Emmitsburg, Maryland, is the oldest US replica of the Lourdes shrine in France. Mother Seton and her sisters lived near the Grotto in a log cabin and attended Sunday Mass at the chapel on the mountain.

### Cutscene 5: The Journey to Emmitsburg (Before Level 5)
**Location**: After defeating Administration Building boss  
**Background**: Fading from campus to a road/travel scene, then to the Grotto exterior  
**Characters**: Emily, Ghost of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton

**Sprite Configuration**:
- Emily: `emily-right.png` (standing sprite)
- Emily dialogue portrait: `emily-headshot-for-cutscenes+dialog.png` (displays when Emily speaks)
- Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton: `angel-flipped.gif` (animated, powerful angelic form preparing for final battle)

**Dialogue**:

**GHOST**: *appearing as Emily catches her breath after the boss battle* You did it! You actually did it! The Administration Building is cleansed!

**EMILY**: *exhausted but triumphant* That was... intense. I never want to see another form in triplicate again.

**GHOST**: *laughing* Oh, Emily, you've earned a rest. But I'm afraid we don't have time for that. The Grotto calls to us.

**EMILY**: *straightening up* Right. Emmitsburg. Satan. Demons. Just another Tuesday.

**GHOST**: *smiling sadly* Your courage humbles me. Come—we must travel to Maryland. It's not far, but it's a journey that will change everything.

*[Scene transition: Images of travel—leaving campus, highway signs, arriving in Emmitsburg]*

**GHOST**: *as they approach the Grotto* There it is. My Grotto. Or what's left of it.

**EMILY**: *looking at the mountainside shrine* It's... it's still beautiful, even now. I can feel the holiness of this place.

**GHOST**: Yes. The Blessed Mother's presence is strong here. But look closer—do you see the darkness creeping through the cave? The shadows that shouldn't be there?

**EMILY**: *peering at the grotto entrance* I see it. It's like... like the cave itself is infected.

**GHOST**: Satan has made his lair in the very heart of the Grotto. He's filled it with demons—twisted creatures of malice and hate. They mock the prayers that were said here, the miracles that happened here, the faith that sustained generations of believers.

**EMILY**: Why here? Why your Grotto specifically?


**GHOST**: *her voice filled with both anger and sorrow* Because I was the first American-born saint. Because I founded the Catholic school system in this country. Because my work, my legacy, represents everything he hates—education, compassion, faith, the elevation of the human spirit. By corrupting this place, he strikes at the very foundation of Catholic education in America.

**EMILY**: Then we'll take it back. We'll drive him out.

**GHOST**: Emily, I need you to understand what you're facing. This isn't like the campus. Those were human failings, human corruption. This is pure evil. Satan himself waits in the depths of that cave, surrounded by his demons. You could die. Your soul could be lost.

**EMILY**: *firmly* Then I'll die fighting for something that matters. You dedicated your life to education, to helping others, to building something beautiful in this world. I'm just a gallery director, but I understand the importance of preserving beauty, of fighting for what's right. If I can help restore your Grotto, if I can honor your legacy... then that's worth any risk.

**GHOST**: *tears in her ghostly eyes* You are braver than you know, Emily. Braver than I was, perhaps. Very well—enter the Grotto. Fight through the demons. Find Satan in the deepest chamber, and cast him out. Use my relics, use your courage, and know that I am with you every step of the way.

**EMILY**: Will you... will you be there? In the cave?

**GHOST**: I cannot enter while he holds dominion there. The darkness repels me. But the moment you weaken him, the moment his grip falters, I will be there. And I won't be alone.

**EMILY**: What do you mean?

**GHOST**: *smiling mysteriously* You'll see. Now go, Emily. Go into the darkness, and bring back the light. Show Satan that he has no power over faith, over love, over the legacy of those who serve God.

**EMILY**: *turning toward the cave entrance* For you, Saint Elizabeth. For the students. For everyone who believes in something better.

**GHOST**: *softly* For all of us.

**Historical Note**: Mother Seton lived and worked in Emmitsburg, Maryland, where she founded her religious community and school. The Grotto was already considered a holy place during her lifetime, and she and her sisters attended Mass at the chapel on the mountain every Sunday.

**Location**: Inside the Grotto cave, after defeating Satan  
**Background**: Cave interior, darkness lifting, light streaming in  
**Characters**: Emily, Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton (transformed/triumphant form)  
**Animation**: Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton transforms into her triumphant, glorified form

- Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton (initial): `angel-flipped.gif` (animated, angelic form)
- Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton (transformed): `anne-seton-triumphant.gif` (animated, glorified triumphant form - plays during transformation sequence)

**Dialogue**:

**EMILY**: *breathing heavily, standing over the defeated form of Satan* It's... it's done. He's gone.

*[The darkness in the cave begins to lift. Light streams through cracks in the rock. The oppressive atmosphere dissipates.]*

**GHOST**: *appearing in a brilliant glow* EMILY! You did it! You actually defeated him!

**EMILY**: *collapsing to her knees* I couldn't have done it without your relics. Without your guidance. Without knowing what you stood for.

**GHOST**: *rushing to Emily's side* You are remarkable, my dear. Truly remarkable. You've restored the Grotto, cleansed the campus, and proven that one person with courage can stand against any darkness.

*[A brilliant light fills the cave. The sound of celestial music. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton's sprite transitions from angel-flipped.gif to anne-seton-triumphant.gif—she transforms from her angelic form into a radiant, glorified saint in full heavenly splendor.]*

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: *in a voice filled with divine authority and joy* The Grotto is free! The darkness is vanquished!

**EMILY**: *in awe* Saint Elizabeth... you're... you're different!

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: *her form radiant and powerful* With Satan's defeat, I can manifest my true form—not just as a ghost bound to earth, but as a saint in glory! You've freed not just this place, Emily, but freed me to show you the fullness of what faith can achieve!

**EMILY**: *stammering* I... I just did what needed to be done.

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: *her voice resonating with power* And in doing so, you've proven that the battle against evil can be won! The adversary has been cast out from this holy place. The Grotto is restored. The corruption on the campus is cleansed. But know this—the battle against evil is never truly over. It must be fought anew in every generation, in every heart.

**EMILY**: *standing, finding strength* I understand. The fight continues. But today, we celebrate this victory.

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: *turning to Emily with radiant compassion* You have been given a great gift—the knowledge that evil can be defeated, that corruption can be cleansed, that one person's courage can change the world. Carry this knowledge with you. Share it with others. And never forget that you do not fight alone.

**EMILY**: *finding her voice* I won't forget. I promise.

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: *raising her arms in blessing* Then go in peace, warrior of light. The Grotto is ours once more. May it stand as a testament to faith, to courage, and to the enduring power of good over evil. And may you carry this light with you always!

*[Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton's glorified form becomes even more brilliant, then gently fades, leaving behind a warm, holy presence. The cave is now fully illuminated, beautiful and holy once more.]*

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: *her form now softly glowing, back to her familiar ghostly appearance but with a new peace* Thank you, Emily. Thank you for everything. My Grotto is restored. The campus is cleansed. And most importantly, you've shown that the values I fought for—education, excellence, compassion, courage—still matter in this world.

**EMILY**: *smiling through her own tears* I learned from the best. A woman who converted to a new faith despite social ostracism. Who founded schools and religious communities. Who performed miracles. Who became America's first native-born saint. And who just transformed into a radiant warrior of heaven! If I have even a fraction of your courage, I'll count myself blessed.

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: *laughing* Oh, Emily, you have more than a fraction. You have your own courage, your own strength. And now you have a story to tell—a story of how one gallery director saved a university and a holy shrine from darkness. And witnessed a saint in her full glory!

**EMILY**: *looking around the restored Grotto* What happens now?

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: Now? Now you return to your gallery. You continue your work. You educate, you inspire, you maintain standards of excellence. And when you see corruption, when you see laziness, when you see those TERRIBLE portraits... *she grins* ...you remember that you once threw bad art at Satan himself and won.

**EMILY**: *laughing* I don't think I'll ever forget that. Or the sight of you in your full saintly glory!

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: *smiling warmly* Good. And Emily? Thank you. For believing in me. For believing in what I stood for. For proving that my legacy—our legacy—is worth fighting for. You gave me the chance to show my true power, my true form. That's a gift I can never repay.

**EMILY**: *bowing her head* It was an honor, Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton.

**SAINT ELIZABETH**: *beginning to fade* The honor was mine, Emily. Now go—the world needs more people like you. People who care about beauty, about truth, about doing what's right even when it's hard. And remember... *her voice echoing as she fades* ...always maintain your artistic standards!

**EMILY**: *laughing as the ghost disappears* I will. I promise.

*[Emily stands alone in the restored Grotto, light streaming through the cave, the sound of birds singing outside. She takes a deep breath, picks up one last terrible portrait that was left behind, and walks toward the exit.]*

**EMILY**: *to herself, smiling* Time to go home. And maybe... maybe time to update the gallery's collection standards.

*[Fade to black. Credits roll.]*

**Historical Note**: Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton's legacy continues through the Catholic school system she founded, the Sisters of Charity she established, and the countless lives she touched through her work. She was canonized on September 14, 1975, and her feast day is celebrated on January 4th, the anniversary of her death in 1821.

- Dry humor, especially in absurd situations
- Professional background shows in her observations
- Respectful of the saint but not overly reverent
- Determined once committed to a cause

### Corrupt Priest Dialogue (Satirical)
- Superficially friendly but with predatory undertones
- References to "special attention," "private meetings," "trust"
- Emphasis on authority and obedience
- Manipulative language patterns
- Should make players uncomfortable in a way that highlights the real-world issue

### Lazy Student Dialogue
- Apathetic and dismissive
- References to social media, avoiding work
- Complaints about effort required
- Entitled attitude
- Comic relief but also commentary on educational challenges

### Clueless Administrator Dialogue
- Obsessed with procedures and forms
- "Not my department" mentality
- Bureaucratic jargon
- Inability to see the bigger picture
- Comic relief representing institutional dysfunction

### Demon Dialogue (Level 5)
- Threatening and malevolent
- References to corruption and despair
- Mocking of faith and hope
- Should feel genuinely menacing
- Contrast with earlier enemies' more mundane evil

### Satan's Dialogue (Final Boss)
- Grandiose and theatrical
- Claims of inevitability of corruption
- Mocking of Saint Elizabeth's legacy
- Should feel like ultimate evil
- Defeated by Emily's courage and faith

## Visual Storytelling Elements

### Cutscene Backgrounds
- **Opening**: Parking lot with campus buildings visible in background
- **Level 2 Intro**: Campus map transitioning to gallery
- **Level 3 Intro**: Campus map transitioning to library
- **Level 4 Intro**: Campus map transitioning to administration building
- **Level 5 Intro**: Travel montage, then Grotto exterior
- **Victory**: Cave interior transforming from dark to light, Saint Elizabeth in glorified form

### Character Sprites in Cutscenes

**Emily**:
- Standing sprite: `emily-right.png`
- Dialogue portrait: `emily-headshot-for-cutscenes+dialog.png` (displays when Emily is speaking)

**Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton** (progression through cutscenes):
- Cutscenes 1-3: `round-ghost-sprite_0-left.png` (ghostly form)
- Cutscenes 4-5: `angel-flipped.gif` (animated, more powerful angelic form)
- Cutscene 6: `anne-seton-triumphant.gif` (animated, glorified triumphant form)

**Technical Notes**:
- All .gif files should play as animations if supported by Phaser
- Emily's headshot portrait appears alongside dialogue text when she speaks
- Saint Elizabeth's sprite remains visible on screen but doesn't have a separate dialogue portrait

### Environmental Storytelling
- Bad portraits visible throughout campus levels
- Increasing darkness as approaching final level
- Light and beauty returning after victories
- Grotto transformation from corrupted to holy

## Audio Design for Cutscenes

### Music Cues
- **Opening**: Mysterious, slightly ominous
- **Mid-game cutscenes**: Hopeful but tense
- **Journey to Emmitsburg**: Epic, building tension
- **Victory**: Triumphant, celebratory, divine

### Sound Effects
- Ghost appearance: Ethereal whoosh
- Saint Elizabeth's transformation: Angelic choir, powerful divine presence
- Satan's defeat: Dramatic, cathartic
- Grotto restoration: Peaceful, holy ambiance
