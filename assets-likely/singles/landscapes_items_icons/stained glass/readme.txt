This is a pack of photographs of stained glass windows, specifically of the Saint-Jacques Saint-Christophe de la Villette church in Paris, France.

All photos were taken by Coyau and uploaded to Commons in 2012. They are licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0 or earlier as well as the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version.

I mirrored them in OpenGameArt because their dark surroundings and minimal perspective distortion make them useful resources for digital artists. 

This pack includes 7 windows from the choir plus one from the lower side wall. All files are 1500x3000 pixel jpegs. Additional camera metadata can be found in the files or on the source link.

The link below has more photos which I chose not to include because they were not from the same set. I hope you find this useful.
